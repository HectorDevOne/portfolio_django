# portfolio_django

This repository aim to be a practice camp for building sites, web applications and services using Django.

As priority, I would like to build backend applications and in some point along the way I build some basic front end for every application. After the first application be ready it will be put onto production.  

The readme file will be updated to reflect the latest advance on the project.
